# FoobarChallenges

In this repository I will share my solution proposals to some of the challenges of Google Foobar.
These solutios were created by me and can be helpful if you need to find tips towards some of the solutions of the challenges. Most likely the solutions that I show are not the most efficient, but I will try to show the insight and thinking process that I took to solve these challenges.

Documentation of the solutions is still a work in progress. At the moment the following problems still need documentation.
+ ALL

I hope this repository can be helpful if you feel stuck in some problems.
